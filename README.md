## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project follows a clean, feature-first architecture to separate concerns and improve scalability.

- **Core:** Contains shared components, utilities, and a base setup for the entire application.
    - `utils`: Service locator (`get_it`), API service (`dio`), and routing (`go_router`).
    - `errors`: Custom failure classes for handling API and server errors.
    - `widgets`: Reusable custom widgets like buttons and loading indicators.
- **Features:** The application is divided into distinct features: `splash`, `home`, and `search`. Each feature module contains its own `data` and `presentation` layers.
    - `data`:
        - **Models:** Dart classes representing the book data from the Google Books API.
        - **Repositories:** Abstract classes defining contracts for data operations and their concrete implementations (`HomeRepo`, `SearchRepo`).
    - `presentation`:
        - **Manager (Cubit):** State management logic using `flutter_bloc` to handle UI state and business logic.
        - **Views:** The screens and UI of the application.
        - **Widgets:** UI components specific to a particular feature.
